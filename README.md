# Techdegree Project 1
 My first Techdegree project: Random Quote Generator

#### An app to show random quotes whenever the button is activated.

#### By **Marcus Parmentier**

## Description

An app created mainly with PHP focusing on different types of array usage to store info and use of functions to retrieve info from a multidimensional array and inner associative array per quote. Then have a function grab a quote and display on the page.
